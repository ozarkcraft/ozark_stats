# Ozark Stats
We wanted to add some statistics for our HCMC100 server so that we could have
scores for a winner.  The thought behind it is to recreate all of the standard
minecraft advancements that triggers a score incrementer as a reward.  This
score is `ozarkadv`.

# Stats Added
We've also added some other scoreboard objectives to be used, specifically the 
winRatioS.  This is the player's playtime (in minutes) divided by the amount of
advancements that they have accumulated.

Other stats are:

* walkKmShow
* walkMShow
* sprintKmShow
* sprintMShow
* totalDistMShow
* totalDistShow
* winRatioS
* ozarkAdv
* ozarkPlaytimeS
